        <h4 style="color: blue">1. Geographical Location</h4>
        <p1 style=" margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; background-color: pink; color: blue ">
            The geographic center of Kentucky is located in Marion
            County, 3 miles NNW of Lebanon. Kentucky is bordered by
            Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio in the north. On the south,
            Kentucky is bordered by Tennessee.</p1> <br /> <br />
        <h4 style="color:blue">2. National Hero</h4>
        <p2 style=" margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px; background-color: black; color: yellow ">
            Abraham Lincoln was born Sunday, Feb. 12, 1809, in a log cabin near Hodgenville,
            Kentucky, created the Emancipation Proclamation which was a bill that that freed
            the slaves from slavery. Abraham Lincoln also created a speech called “The Gettysburg Address.”
            Daniel Boone (November 2, 1734 [O.S. October 22] – September 26, 1820) was an
            American pioneer, explorer, woodsman, and frontiersman, whose frontier exploits
            made him one of the first folk heroes of the United States. Boone is most
            famous for his exploration and settlement of what is now Kentucky.</p2> <br /> <br />
        <h4 style="color:blue">3. Population</h4>
        <p3 style=" margin-left: 38px; background-color: green; color: white ">
            Kentucky's estimated population of 4.47 million in 2018 reflects a modest
            rise on the official Census figures from 2010. Kentucky currently has
            a population growth rate of 0.47%, which ranks 34th among the US states.</p3> <br /> <br />
        <h4 style="color:blue">4. Education</h4>
        <p1 style=" margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; background-color: pink; color: blue ">
            Welcome to the new era in public education in the Commonwealth of Kentucky - designed to ensure
            every child reaches his/her learning potential and graduates from high school ready for college and career.
            This program lays the foundation for what students should learn, what will be tested, how
            subjects will be tested, when tests are given, what should comprise the public school
            accountability system and more.</p1> <br /> <br />
        <h4 style="color:blue">5. Agriculture</h4>
        <p2 style=" margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px; background-color: black; color: yellow ">
            Kentucky once was described as a “land of contrasts,” and the same can be said of the
            Commonwealth’s fast-changing agriculture industry. Kentucky farmers achieved a
            record $5.7 billion in farm cash receipts in 2013. Kentucky’s leading
            agricultural product in cash receipts was poultry and eggs at more than
            $1.2 billion. Kentucky is, of course, the Horse Capital of the World,
            and sales of horses and stud fees accounted for cash receipts of nearly
            $400 million. Kentucky is the leading beef cattle state east of the Mississippi
            River with more than 1 million beef cows as of Jan. 1, 2015. Other major
            commodities include corn, soybeans, burley tobacco, dairy products, hay, and wheat.</p2><br /> <br />
